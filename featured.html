              <p>
                I've been running Inspirational Pixels since 2016, so around
                five years. In that time the site has built up quite a large
                archive of varying content.
              </p>
              <p>
                The real aim of the redesign was to make the content easily
                accessible, but have a focus on showing the difference between
                pieces of content.
            
                The main staples of content on the site are tutorials, articles,
                freebies and snippets, so there needed to be a way of easily
                identifying what each piece was without having to click into it.  
              </p>
              
              <h2 class="text-secondary">The Result</h2>
              <p>
                Everything is now easily identifiable by having a unique card
                design for each post preview. The cards are dynamic change
                depending on what type of content they are.
              <p>
                Posts that are either tutorials or articles are tagged with a
                matching icon. Freebies show the file size at the bottom of the
                card and snippets show the code language the snippet is written in.  
              </p>
              <p>
                I also had the opportunity to rework the placement of the ads on
                the site. Before it was annoying to see ads plastered in the
                sidebar. Now in the redesign, the sidebar is gone and ads flow
                better in the overall design, yet are still obvious that they
                are advertisements.
